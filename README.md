# Employee Database

## Overview

###     With our main [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/tree/main/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Data) tables, our mission is to extract key information about the employees. Such analysis can be those retiring and those eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

### - There are a total of 72,458 employees retiring.

### - The top three retiring titles are Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, and Engineer with 25,916, 24,926, and 9,285 employees, respectively.

### - There are a total of 1,549 people eligible for the mentorship progam.

### - The top three eligible mentorship titles are Senior Staff, Senior Engineer, and Engineer with 569, 529, and 190 employees, respectively.

## Summary

###     With our main data source we were able to create [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/tree/main/Data) exports to show mentorship eligibilty, retirement titles, retiring titles, and unique titles. Our main takeaway is that 72,458 people are retiring and there are 1,549 eligible mentors. This is possible, however, it depends on the effort needed since each mentor will be responsible for around 40-50 employees. There are two additional queries that may help with determining if it is possible. First, a query showing aligning the mentors with the count of employees in their old roles. Second, a query containing information on how many of the current employees would actually desire a mentor. This information can allow the mentorship to be much more feasible.
